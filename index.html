    <h1 > 1.History of WWW</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag to define the structure of web pages.
 <br><br>
    This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
        <br>
    </p>
    <h1>2.Evoluation of HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

     Currently, we are using HTML5, which is the latest and most recent version of HTML.</p>
    <h1>3.Differnt HTML versions</h1>
    <p><pre>1991- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0
    1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.
    1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.
    1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. <br>, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
    1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.
    2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.</pre></p>
    <h1>4.Why HTML 5</h1>

    * Drag and Drop- The user can grab an object and drag it further dropping it to a new location.
    * Geo-location services- It helps to locate the geographical location of a client.
    * Web storage facility which provides web application methods to store data on the web browser.
    * Uses SQL database to store data offline.
    * Allows drawing various shapes like triangle, rectangle, circle, etc.
    * Capable of handling incorrect syntax.
    <!-- * Easy DOCTYPE declaration i.e., <!doctype html> -->
    * Easy character encoding i.e., <meta charset=”UTF-8″> </pre>

    Browsers that, collectively, cover 95% of the world: Firefox, Chrome, IE6/7/8. The best way to test them is to install them on your computer.</p>
